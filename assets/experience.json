			"description": "Worked as a Software Craftsman for “E-Data Now!” (EDN) product. EDN is a near real time data collection system. The primary use case is inspection and auditing in the automotive industry. Typically a user will perform audits using EDN Client (iOS/Swift/C++) and enter their Time sheet’s using EDN Time (Flutter/Dart). The data is pushed up to a Rails API, where it’s presented to the Web Administrators using a cutting edge Nuxt.js/Vue.js frontend stack. I had the opportunity to write code for the frontend, and backend while assisting with mobile bug fixes. Beyond my developer duties, I maintained test plans and test cases for the entire suite of EDN products. While performing testing duties, I was also mandated to write automated and load tests.",
